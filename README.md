# numGo
N A library inspired to provide methods and functions that
give scope for performing numerical and scientific calculations
in `go-lang`

# Inspiration
Inspired by `numpy` for `python`, `numGo` aims to replicate all the
mathematical concepts that are covered in `numpy`. Therefore, most
of the concepts and ideas are broadly taken from `numpy`.
