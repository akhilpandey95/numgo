# numgo
A library that is aimed at providing methods and functions that
give scope for performing numerical and scientific calculations
in `go-lang`. The core concept to `numgo` library is that everything
is an array and all operations, calculations, functions and routines
that correspond to are in reference to that `n-dimensional` array.

# Inspiration
Inspired by `numpy` for `python`, `numGo` aims to replicate all the
mathematical concepts that are covered in `numpy`. Therefore, most
of the concepts and ideas are broadly taken from `numpy`.
